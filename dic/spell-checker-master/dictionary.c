/****************************************************************************
 * dictionary.c
 *
 * Computer Science 50
 * Problem Set 6
 *
 * Implements a dictionary's functionality.
 *
 * Functions/definitions in this program are used in speller.c to help create a 
 * spellchecker.  Functions include load, unload, check, and size.  Load runs 
 * through a text file full of words and loads them into memory as a hash table
 * (dictionary).  Unload frees the memory the hash table is using after it is 
 * no longer needed.  Check performs a lookup on the hash table to determine 
 * if a word is in the dictionary (if not it's mispelled).  Size counts the number
 * of words in the dictionary.
 *
 * I implemented dictionary.c myself, but take no credit for speller.c as it was
 * already implemented as a part this assignment for edx cs50.
